### Made with Vite + React-ts

## Folder Structure
 public	
  - images

 src
  - components -- reusable components
  - constants -- api urls, avatar urls (usually placed in env file)
  - hoc -- higher order components folder 
  - hooks -- folder for custom hooks
  - libs -- third party libraries that can be extended
  - pages -- handle pages/component
  - styles
    - abstract -- css variables
    - base -- reset, typographies or breakpoints
    - components -- alternative way to style components but mostly global styles for components
    - pages -- alternative way to styles pages and mostly global styles for pages
  - types -- data types
  - utils -- folder ready for reusable functions

### Approach
I tried Coding as much as possible with SOLID principles in mind. 
Also usage of HOC, Typescript Generics, and DRY Code to extend components reusability and 
**Accessibility for screen readers.**
